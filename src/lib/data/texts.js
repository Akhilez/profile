export const bio = `

I am a Deep Learning Engineer at VNDLY and 
I majored in Artificial Intelligence in my Masters.
In my free time, I develop **[ml.gallery](https://ml.gallery)**.
Also, I won the largest hackathon at my university.

I am obsessed with _Deep Learning_ üß†, Productivity üë®üèª‚Äçüíª and Space Exploration ü™ê
